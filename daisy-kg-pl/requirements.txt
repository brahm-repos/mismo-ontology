# Requirements for the Ontology Instance Generator
# These are standard Python libraries, no external packages needed

# The script uses only built-in Python libraries:
# - json: for JSON file processing
# - glob: for file pattern matching
# - re: for regular expressions
# - uuid: for unique identifier generation
# - datetime: for timestamp generation
# - typing: for type hints
# - logging: for logging functionality

# No external packages required - all dependencies are built-in to Python 3.6+
